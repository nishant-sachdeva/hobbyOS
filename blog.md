Installations :

1. QEMU : We need to install Qemu. This is a virtual machine running tool where we shall run and test our Operating System. This gives us the luxury of being able to play around with our code and test rapidly.

2. NASM : Next installation is that of NASM . We don't know how to write Machine Language, so what we'll do is write in the Intel assembly language, and compile it into machine instructions.
